Being a teaching assistant has been a rewarding experience. It has allowed me to deepen my understanding of Linguistics and, more recently, Cognitive Science and AI. 
I have cherished the opportunity to explore diverse course topics while actively 
supporting students in their learning journeys. Helping students understand complex 
concepts and witnessing their growth has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my academic career.
