My main refuge from all the thinking and hustle of work is yoga and meditation. 
It all started when I was 17 and traveled to India for the first time. 
That was where I first became familiar with yoga and began practicing it on a regular basis. 
I did some basic yoga teacher training at a young age, but I never pursued it seriously and instead kept it as a private, 
sacred moment to listen to my body.

In 2024, in the middle of my PhD, after a conversation with one of the postdocs about how stressful academia had been for him 
and how it was negatively affecting his health, I realized how beneficial yoga can be for students, especially those 
navigating the challenges of graduate studies. I decided to do an intensive 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training program at 
[Pranashanti Yoga School](https://pranashanti.com/) in Ottawa, Canada, during the summer of 2024. I applied for the scholarship that Pranashanti was offering to one individual and was fortunate to 
be accepted into the program. 

Balancing my PhD with the demands of this 200-hour intensive training was not easy, but I managed to do both.
Although it was challenging, the experience strengthened my belief in creating spaces where students can focus on their well-being. In 2025, I had 
the opportunity to teach a yoga flow class at Carleton University's 
Athletics Center. There I met many students and staff who, like me, were seeking a space and time to attend to their bodies 
and minds. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, and it inspired me to continue spreading yoga among 
students and colleagues.

Yoga has always been a cornerstone of my journey. It has helped me stay grounded and resilient through the rigors of academic life. 
My hope is to share this practice with others, to help them discover balance, mindfulness, and a sense of connection.
