    After more than a decade of practicing yoga for my own mental and physical health, 
    I realized how transformative yoga can be for students, especially those navigating 
    the challenges of graduate studies. As a PhD student, I decided to pursue an intensive 
    200-hour Yoga Teacher Training program at 
    <a href="https://pranashanti.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Pranashanti Yoga School
    </a> in Ottawa, Canada, during summer 2024.

    Though challenging, the experience reinforced my belief in the importance of creating 
    spaces where students can prioritize their well-being. In Winter 2025, I had the opportunity 
    to teach a Yoga class at 
    <a href="https://athletics.carleton.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Carleton Universityâ€™s Athletics Center
    </a>.

    Yoga has been a cornerstone of my journey, helping me stay grounded and resilient 
    through the rigors of academic life. I hope to share the practice with others to foster 
    balance, mindfulness, and a sense of community.
