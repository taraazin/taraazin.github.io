<p>
 After more than a decade of practicing yoga for my own mental and physical health,
 I realized how transformative yoga can be for students, especially those navigating
 the challenges of graduate studies. As a PhD student, I decided to pursue an intensive
 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training program at
<a href="https://pranashanti.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 Pranashanti Yoga School
</a> in Ottawa, Canada, during summer 2024.
</p>
<p>
 Though challenging, the experience reinforced my belief in the importance of creating
 spaces where students can prioritize their well-being. In Winter 2025, I had the opportunity
 to teach a Yoga class at
<a href="https://athletics.carleton.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 Carleton University's Athletics Center
</a>.
</p>
<p>
 Yoga has been a cornerstone of my journey, helping me stay grounded and resilient
 through the rigors of academic life. I hope to share the practice with others to foster
 balance, mindfulness, and a sense of community.
