I'm a PhD student in Linguistics with a background in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics. My interest and current studies are in computational semantics, which is all about how machines can learn the meaning of language as humans do.

Meaning itself is quite controversial among us humans â€” we can be sarcastic, tell lies, and spread misinformation. Knowing the fact that even humans struggle to understand language makes the idea of machines deciphering meaning quite mind-boggling. Will machines ever understand meaning better than humans? In my PhD research, I explore this question alongside methods to improve machines' understanding of human language.
