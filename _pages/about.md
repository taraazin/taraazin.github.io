I'm a PhD student in Linguistics with a background in Computational Linguistics. My interest and current studies is in computational semantics, which is all about how machines can learn the meaning of language like humans do.

Meaning itself is quite controversial among us humans â€” we can be sarcastic, tell lies, and spread misinformation. Knowing the fact  that even humans struggle to understand language makes the idea of machines deciphering meaning quite mind-boggling. In my PhD research, I explore this question and methods to improve machines' understanding of human language.
